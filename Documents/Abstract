This project focuses on the detection of blood cancer through advanced image
processing and machine learning techniques. Blood cancer, which includes leukemia and
lymphoma, significantly impacts patient health and requires timely diagnosis for effective
treatment. By leveraging publicly available datasets of blood smear images, this study applies
various image processing methods to enhance and segment blood cells. Machine learning
algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are utilized to classify images
and detect abnormalities indicative of cancer. The project aims to improve diagnostic accuracy
and reduce the time required for detection, thereby supporting healthcare professionals in making
informed decisions. Additionally, this work highlights the integration of electronics and
communication engineering principles with medical applications, showcasing how technological
advancements can contribute to early cancer detection and improved patient outcomes. The
findings of this project can pave the way for further research in automated diagnostics and real-
time monitoring of blood-related diseases.
