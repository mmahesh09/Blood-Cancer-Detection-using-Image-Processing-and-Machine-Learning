üåü Introduction

This project aims to detect blood cancer by classifying images of blood cells using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to differentiate between normal and cancerous blood cells, providing a tool to assist in early diagnosis and treatment.

üìÅ Dataset

You can use publicly available datasets such as those from the Cancer Imaging Archive or Kaggle. Ensure that the dataset is organized into separate folders for images of cancerous and non-cancerous blood cells.

üì¶ Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Scikit-learn


üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-cancer-detection.git
cd blood-cancer-detection


2. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt



üöÄ Usage

Data Preprocessing

Ensure that your dataset is placed in a folder named data_folder with images labeled accordingly. Preprocess images by resizing and normalizing them to ensure uniformity and remove noise.

Model Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used in this project is designed to efficiently classify images. The model includes several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers to output a binary classification.

Training

Train the model using the training data with data augmentation to improve robustness. Use techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to generate more training samples from the existing dataset.

Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the test data by measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in understanding the model's effectiveness and areas for improvement.

Prediction

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images. The model outputs whether an image is classified as cancerous or normal based on the learned patterns.

Improving the Model

Consider using transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet to improve accuracy. Fine-tune these models on your dataset to leverage their learned features and enhance performance.
