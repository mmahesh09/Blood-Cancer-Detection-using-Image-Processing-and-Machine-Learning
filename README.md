##  What is Blood Cancer?
Blood cancer, or hematologic cancer, is a group of cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, or lymphatic system. It occurs when abnormal blood cells grow uncontrollably, disrupting the production and function of normal blood cells. The main types are leukemia (affecting white blood cells), lymphoma (affecting the lymphatic system), and myeloma (targeting plasma cells in bone marrow). These cancers impair the bodyâ€™s ability to fight infections, carry oxygen, and stop bleeding. Symptoms may include fatigue, fever, infections, bruising, or swollen lymph nodes. Treatment often involves chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or stem cell transplants, depending on the type and severity.

## Problem Statement
Blood cancer detection is a critical challenge in the medical field, as early diagnosis significantly improves treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as blood tests and manual examination of blood samples, can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to develop an automated system for blood cancer detection using image processing and machine learning techniques. By analyzing microscopic images of blood samples, the system will identify and classify abnormal cell patterns indicative of blood cancers like leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma. The goal is to provide a faster, more accurate, and reliable method for early blood cancer detection, assisting healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions.

There are three main types of blood cancer: **Leukemia**, **Lymphoma**, and **Myeloma**. Hereâ€™s a brief description of each:

 ### Leukemia:
 
>"In 2024, 62,770 people are expected to be diagnosed with Leukemia."

   - **Description**: Leukemia is cancer of the blood and bone marrow, primarily affecting white blood cells. It leads to the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells that interfere with the bodyâ€™s ability to fight infections and produce normal blood cells.
   - **Types**: 
     - *Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)*: Affects lymphoid cells and progresses rapidly.
     - *Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)*: Affects myeloid cells, also aggressive.
     - *Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)*: Affects lymphocytes, progresses slowly.
     - *Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)*: Affects myeloid cells, progresses more slowly.

 ### Lymphoma:
 
   >"About 89,190 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with lymphoma in 2024 (8,570 cases of HL and 80,620 cases of NHL)."
   
   - **Description**: Lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system, which includes lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. It begins in the lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) and can affect various parts of the body.
   - **Types**:
     - *Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)*: Characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, usually starts in lymph nodes.
     - *Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)*: A diverse group of blood cancers affecting lymphocytes, can start in lymph nodes or other organs.

 ### Myeloma:
 
   >"An estimated 35,780 new cases of myeloma (19,520 males and 16,260 females) are expected to be diagnosed in the US in 2024"

   - **Description**: Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies. In myeloma, abnormal plasma cells grow uncontrollably, leading to weakened bones, kidney problems, and a weakened immune system.
   - **Symptoms**: Bone pain, fractures, fatigue, and recurrent infections are common in myeloma.

These cancers disrupt normal blood cell production and function, often causing symptoms like fatigue, infections, bleeding, and organ damage. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving outcomes for patients with blood cancers.

## Current Detection Techniques :
Here are two current detection techniques for blood cancer:

 **Blood Tests (Complete Blood Count - CBC)**:
   - A CBC test measures the number and types of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Abnormal levels or unusual cell characteristics can indicate the presence of blood cancer. For example, leukemia may cause an elevated number of white blood cells or the presence of immature cells.

 **Bone Marrow Biopsy**:
   - A bone marrow biopsy involves extracting a sample of bone marrow (usually from the hip bone) to examine for abnormal cell growth. This test helps in diagnosing various blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, providing detailed insights into the type of cancer and its stage.
